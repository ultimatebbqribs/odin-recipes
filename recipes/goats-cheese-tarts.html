    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil </li>
        <li>6 small brown onions, halved, thinly sliced </li>
        <li>2 sheets frozen puff pastry, partially thawed</li>
        <li>16 pitted black olives, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>16 anchovy fillets, halved lengthways</li>
        <li>80g goat’s cheese, crumbled </li>
        <li>32 small watercress sprigs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy-based saucepan over medium heat. Add onion. Stir to coat. Cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 12 minutes or until softened. Remove lid. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for a further 20 to 25 minutes or until golden. Transfer to a bowl. Set aside to cool completely.</li> 
        
        <li>Preheat oven to 220°C/200°C fan-forced. Line 3 baking trays with baking paper. Cut each pastry sheet evenly into 16 squares. Transfer to prepared baking trays. Using a small, sharp knife, score a 1cm border around edge of each pastry square (don't cut all the way through). Spoon onion mixture onto the centre of each tart. Top with olive, anchovy and goat's cheese.</li>

        <li>Bake for 10 minutes or until golden and puffed. Set aside for 2 to 3 minutes to cool slightly. Top with watercress sprigs. Serve.</li>
